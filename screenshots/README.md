## Adding Screenshots to README

Once you've added the screenshots to this directory, they will automatically be referenced in the main README.md file using relative paths like:

```markdown
<img src="screenshots/ios-chat-list.png" alt="iOS Chat List" width="250"/>
```

Make sure to commit and push these images to your GitHub repository for them to display properly on GitHub.
